# Projects

### [Chess Final](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/ChessFinal)
###### *February - March 2021*
This project was done entirely using R, and the dataset is Chess match data found on Kaggle. The steps taken to create a model to predict the winner of a chess match include:

* Cleaning the data
* Creating histograms to show the frequency and distribution of each feature value
* Scatterplots to show relationships between variables followed by finding the mathematic correlation between features
* Found a linear regression model for the data to find winter based on rating and number of wins


Additional analysis could be done to improve the accuracy of the model.

### [Shark Final](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/SharkFinal)
###### *March 2021*
This was an exploratory data analysis project using a Shark Attack dataset. In the EDA, I removed unnecessary columns, created histograms for the different features, and retrieved descriptive statistics for each of the features. I also performed single regression analysis on fatality of shark attacks versus the type of attack. 


Additional analysis should be performed to improve the quality of the analysis of this report. This project was another project early on in my data science career, and this dataset was particularly difficult to work with for a beginner. I also found, in general, it was difficult to find better shark attack data due to the limited free available datasets out there on the subject. However, this is a project I am interested in revisiting.

### [World Happiness](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/WorldHappiness)
###### *April - June 2021*
This project was one of the first introductions I had to data science and exploratory data analysis. Using pandas in Python, I joined datasets from World Happiness surveys taken between 2015 and 2019. I used and looked at data from three different data source types –flat files (csv), website data using BeautifulSoup to perform web scraping of html tables from Wikipedia and from and API (I used the World Bank API). I joined datasets together, removed outliers and plotted some of the data, including boxplots to find outliers and scatterplots to show relationships between features using matplotlib.

### [Wine Features](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/WineFeatures)
###### *April - June 2021*
Using a Wine Classification dataset from Kaggle, I started some exploratory data analysis into what makes a wine expensive and if an expensive wine is worth the price. This is some text analysis, with graphs showing word frequencies in reviews. I included a classification report and a confusion matrix from a K Neighbors classifier. 


Additional analysis should be performed to improve the usefulness and quality of the analysis in this project.

### [Aircraft Crash Analysis](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/AircraftSafety)
###### *September - November 2021*
This project was guided by assignments in one of my data science courses. Given a scenario where we work for airline and must help determine whether aircrafts are still a safe way to travel, I had to find and present data which ended up supporting the claim that aircrafts are still a safe way to travel. This was accomplished primarily using Tableau and is comprised of several different communication methods, including a stakeholder presentation, blog post, infographic, and a presentation that could be used for some sort of broadcast message.

### [Will It Rain in Seattle?](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/SeattleRain)
###### *September - November 2021*
The goal of this project was to use historic rain data on Seattle to predict whether or not it will rain on a particular day. I used both Python and R to accomplish this project – R was used for exploratory analysis and Python was used for modelling. I trained four different classification models to find the best one for the data.


While this project is complete as is, it could be improved by pulling in more weather data that could be useful in predicting whether or not it will rain. The dataset only contained temperature and precipitation data but other factors such as humidity and if it rained the day before could play a factor in Seattle rain patterns.

### [Heart Attack Prediction](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/HeartAttack)
###### *December 2021 - January 2022*
For this project, I used Python to determine features for a model to predict whether someone will have a heart attack. I performed EDA to find features for the model and then I trained multiple models to find the best one to fit the dataset. 


There is limited data in the dataset I found, so further work could be done to get more data for the analysis.

### [Super Bowl Prediction](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/SuperBowl)
###### *January - February 2022*
This project predicts the teams that will play in the Super Bowl based on overall team statistics.
* Pulled data from two web sources: nfl.com and pro-football-reference.com
* Cleaned, prepared and summarized data so it could be merged into one dataset
* Used SelectKBest to get the top 35 features to use to modelling
* Trained three models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree
* Outputted table of the predictions for each team along with probabilities, order by highest probabilities of playing the Super Bowl

### [Language Detection](https://github.com/ixs1022/DSC_Portfolio/tree/main/LanguageDetection)
###### *February 2022 - March 2022*
