# About Me

## Long Story Short...
Four years ago, I started working at a manufacturing plant for General Motors, first as a co-op student, now as a MES/Database Developer. Working with databases in the manufacturing space sparked a love for data and the endless insights that can result in knowing how to work with data. During the early days of quarantine, I had time to consider where I wanted to take my career next and decided to start working towards a Master's in Data Science. Next, I will be seeking opportunities to apply the knowledge I have gained in the "real world".
