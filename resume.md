## Employment
### General Motors Rochester Operations
#### MES/Database Developer - *June 2019 to Current* - *Rochester, NY (Remote)*
* Assisted with server migrations from Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server Core 2016 virtual machines and database migrations of an OLTP and an OLAP database from SQL Server 2012 to SQL Server 2016; configured Window Server 2016 virtual machines with SSAS and SSRS and migrated reports to new Report Server
* Led troubleshooting efforts of the new OLTP databases by monitoring bottleneck queries using SQL Spotlight, optimizing stored procedures and working with global IT teams to increase storage and memory resources on the database servers
* Developed a feature for the internal part tracking web application using SQL Server, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Flask to allow machine operators to troubleshoot failed verifications at the workstation and get machines running in a timely manner without needing engineer intervention
* Diagnosed a long-standing bottleneck in our database system that caused blocking and slowed or failed transaction; implemented a solution that eliminated the blocking and improved average transaction times by 250%

### Computer Science Co-op - *Jan 2018 to May 2019* - *Rochester, NY*
* Collaborated with Controls Engineers to plan and then implemented the database solution for tracking non-serialized batch parts by designing and creating new SQL tables and stored procedures for data collection, processing and storage
* Developed new SSRS reports to view batch data, including a custom report for showing reject types and counts at a high-scrap process step for quality engineers to be able to analyze and implement scrap reduction plans
* Created a virtual machine with a copy of the production SQL Server databases, internal part tracking application and SSRS on a stand-alone PC used at machine builder sites for testing; configured the site server using Internet Information Services, setup the Report Server using the Reporting Services Configuration Manager, and enabled bridged networking to allow the host machine to run the sites without needing to access the sensitive information stored on the VM

## Projects
### Super Bowl Teams Prediction - *Jan 2022 to Feb 2022*
Combined data from two web sources to predict which teams are most likely to play in the Super Bowl.

* Cleaned and prepared the data to be merged into a single dataset
* Selected the top 35 features using SelectKBest from sklearn.feature_selection
* Scaled the data using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing and trained three models: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Random Forest (96% accuracy)
* Used current season statistics to input into the model and output a table of the predictions with probabilities for each team

### Will it Rain in Seattle? - *Sept 2021 to Nov 2021*
Predictive analytics project using historical rain data from Seattle. Given a date, the models will predict whether or not it will rain that day in Seattle.
* Used R to perform some exploratory data analysis on the data, including creating histograms, bar charts and line charts of the data
* Prepared and modeled the data in Python using Jupyter NotebookTrained and tested four models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree (76% accuracy)
